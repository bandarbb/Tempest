Tempest Incident

In this incident, you will act as an Incident Responder from an alert triaged by one of your Security Operations Center analysts. The analyst has confirmed that the alert has a **CRITICAL** severity that needs further investigation.

As reported by the <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">SOC</span> analyst, the intrusion started from a malicious document. In addition, the analyst compiled the essential information generated by the alert as listed below:

- The malicious document has a **.doc** extension.
- The user downloaded the malicious document via **chrome.exe**.
- The malicious document then executed a chain of commands to attain code execution.

Investigation Guide

To aid with the investigation, you may refer to the cheatsheet crafted by the team applicable to this scenario:

- Start with the events generated by <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">Sysmon</span>.
- EvtxEcmd, Timeline Explorer, and SysmonView can interpret <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">Sysmon</span> logs.
- Follow the child processes of WinWord.exe.
- Use filters such as ParentProcessID or ProcessID to correlate the relationship of each process.
- We can focus on Sysmon events such as Process Creation (Event ID 1) and <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">DNS</span> Queries (Event ID 22) to correlate the activity generated by the malicious document.

Significant Data Sources:

- <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">Sysmon</span>


Q1: The user of this machine was compromised by a malicious document. What is the file name of the document?

Open the Timeline Explorer and open the sysmon.csv that we parsed earlier in the room.

We have two clues from the alert generated so we can either use ".doc" or "chrome.exe" at the search bar on the top right.

Q2: What is the name of the compromised user and machine?
*Format: username-machine name*

We'll be able to see who downloaded or opened the malicious document on the same row.

ANS: benimaru-TEMPEST

Q3: What is the PID of the Microsoft Word process that opened the malicious document?

We'll use the name of the malicious in the search bar and we can look for Event ID 1 which is Process Creation.

ANS: 496

Q4: Based on Sysmon logs, what is the IPv4 address resolved by the malicious domain used in the previous question?

Let's take a note of where and when the malicious file opened and we'll start our investigation from there.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa2c51d-9aa6-4a0d-a39d-6bdd8e11f0ac)

We know that the malicious document was opened by PID 496 (winword.exe) and user "benimaru" so we will be filtering the events of that particular process and user.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af2145b5-e640-4300-a3eb-4579cbcbd8d8)

To answer the question, we'll take a closer look at Event IDs 3 and 22 which are "Network Connection" and "DNS Event" respectively.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a2185e8-c362-4f4d-9b19-678d05c15053)

And once we examine the rows of those records, we'll have our answer.

ANS: 167.71.199.191

Q5: What is the base64 encoded string in the malicious payload executed by the document?

Now we have to find out the Child Processes that PID 496 (winword.exe) created when it opened the malicious document. We can do that by setting PID 496 as the Parent Process which in this case, located at "Payload Data5" column.
The payload will immediately stick out from the "Executable Info" column.

Q6: What is the CVE number of the exploit used by the attacker to achieve a remote code execution?
*Format: XXXX-XXXXX*

Study the payload for a bit and after a bit of googling, we'll find this page: https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Msdt/

=================================================

<span style="color: #ff5965;">Task 5</span><span style="color: #e5e3df;">Initial Access - Stage 2 execution</span>

Malicious Document - Stage 2

Based on the initial findings, we discovered that there is a stage 2 execution:

- The document has successfully executed an encoded base64 command.
- Decoding this string reveals the exact command chain executed by the malicious document.

Investigation Guide

With the following discoveries, we may refer again to the cheatsheet to continue with the investigation:

- The Autostart execution reflects explorer.exe as its parent process ID.
- Child processes of explorer.exe within the event timeframe could be significant.
- Process Creation (Event ID 1) and File Creation (Event ID 11) succeeding the document execution are worth checking.

Significant Data Sources:

- <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">Sysmon</span>

Answer the questions below

Q1: The malicious execution of the payload wrote a file on the system. What is the full target path of the payload?

Decode the base64

ANS: C:\Users\benimaru\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

Q2: The implanted payload executes once the user logs into the machine. What is the executed command upon a successful login of the compromised user?

*Format: Remove the double quotes from the log.*

We figure that the payload will autostart and a process will be created with explorer as our parent process. After using the appropriate filters, we found this.

Q3: Based on Sysmon logs, what is the SHA256 hash of the malicious binary downloaded for stage 2 execution?

Look for the instances of the downloaded "first.exe"

Q4: The stage 2 payload downloaded establishes a connection to a c2 server. What is the domain and port used by the attacker?

*Format: domain:port*

After looking around the events surrounding "first.exe", we found this:
