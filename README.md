<h3>Tempest Incident</h3>

In this incident, you will act as an Incident Responder from an alert triaged by one of your Security Operations Center analysts. The analyst has confirmed that the alert has a **CRITICAL** severity that needs further investigation.

As reported by the <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">SOC</span> analyst, the intrusion started from a malicious document. In addition, the analyst compiled the essential information generated by the alert as listed below:

- The malicious document has a **.doc** extension.
- The user downloaded the malicious document via **chrome.exe**.
- The malicious document then executed a chain of commands to attain code execution.

Investigation Guide

To aid with the investigation, you may refer to the cheatsheet crafted by the team applicable to this scenario:

- Start with the events generated by <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">Sysmon</span>.
- EvtxEcmd, Timeline Explorer, and SysmonView can interpret <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">Sysmon</span> logs.
- Follow the child processes of WinWord.exe.
- Use filters such as ParentProcessID or ProcessID to correlate the relationship of each process.
- We can focus on Sysmon events such as Process Creation (Event ID 1) and <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">DNS</span> Queries (Event ID 22) to correlate the activity generated by the malicious document.

Significant Data Sources:

- <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">Sysmon</span>

<p align="center">Answer the questions below</p>

<p align="center">Q1: The user of this machine was compromised by a malicious document. What is the file name of the document?</p>

Open the Timeline Explorer and open the sysmon.csv that we parsed earlier in the room.

We have two clues from the alert generated so we can either use ".doc" or "chrome.exe" at the search bar on the top right.

ANS: free_magicules.doc

<p align="center">Q2: What is the name of the compromised user and machine?
*Format: username-machine name*

We'll be able to see who downloaded or opened the malicious document on the same row.

ANS: benimaru-TEMPEST

<p align="center">Q3: What is the PID of the Microsoft Word process that opened the malicious document?

We'll use the name of the malicious in the search bar and we can look for Event ID 1 which is Process Creation.

<p align="center">![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd34230f-af1a-471c-a8f1-ce9f7b5deb76)

ANS: 496

<p align="center">Q4: Based on Sysmon logs, what is the IPv4 address resolved by the malicious domain used in the previous question?

Let's take a note of where and when the malicious file opened and we'll start our investigation from there.

<p align="center">![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa2c51d-9aa6-4a0d-a39d-6bdd8e11f0ac)

We know that the malicious document was opened by PID 496 (winword.exe) and user "benimaru" so we will be filtering the events of that particular process and user.

<p align="center">![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af2145b5-e640-4300-a3eb-4579cbcbd8d8)

To answer the question, we'll take a closer look at Event IDs 3 and 22 which are "Network Connection" and "DNS Event" respectively.

<p align="center">![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a2185e8-c362-4f4d-9b19-678d05c15053)

And once we examine the rows of those records, we'll have our answer.

<p align="center">ANS: 167.71.199.191

<p align="center">Q5: What is the base64 encoded string in the malicious payload executed by the document?

Now we have to find out the Child Processes that PID 496 (winword.exe) created when it opened the malicious document. We can do that by setting PID 496 as the Parent Process which in this case, located at "Payload Data5" column.
The payload will immediately stick out from the "Executable Info" column.

<p align="center"><h3>Initial Access - Stage 2 execution</h3>

Malicious Document - Stage 2

Based on the initial findings, we discovered that there is a stage 2 execution:

- The document has successfully executed an encoded base64 command.
- Decoding this string reveals the exact command chain executed by the malicious document.

Investigation Guide

With the following discoveries, we may refer again to the cheatsheet to continue with the investigation:

- The Autostart execution reflects explorer.exe as its parent process ID.
- Child processes of explorer.exe within the event timeframe could be significant.
- Process Creation (Event ID 1) and File Creation (Event ID 11) succeeding the document execution are worth checking.

Significant Data Sources:

- <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">Sysmon</span>

<p align="center">Answer the questions below

Q1: The malicious execution of the payload wrote a file on the system. What is the full target path of the payload?

Decode the base64

<p align="center"><h3>Initial Access - Malicious Document Traffic</h3>

Malicious Document Traffic

Based on the collected findings, we discovered that the attacker fetched the stage 2 payload remotely:

- We discovered the Domain and IP invoked by the malicious document on <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">Sysmon</span> logs.
- There is another domain and IP used by the stage 2 payload logged from the same data source.

Investigation Guide

Since we have discovered network-related artefacts, we may again refer to our cheatsheet, which focuses on Network Log Analysis:

- We can now use **Brim and Wireshark** to investigate the packet capture.
- Find network events related to the harvested domains and IP addresses.
- Sample Brim filter that you can use for this investigation: `_path=="http" "<malicious domain>"`

Data Sources:

- Packet Capture

<p align="center">Answer the questions below

For this, I'll be using Brim and look for the malicious domain that we found earlier.

I used this filter to get the overview of the conversation that happened between the malicious domains and the host but you can use a more specific filter from the information we gathered from before.

_path=="http" | cut id.orig_h, id.resp_h, id.resp_p, method, host, uri | uniq -c | sort value.host

<p align="center">![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e643084a-df5b-41a8-9c84-1f8441d42f46)


<p align="center">Q1: What is the URL of the malicious payload embedded in the document?

*refer to the Brim result*

<p align="center">ANS:h[tt]p://phishteam[.]xyz/02dcf07/index[.]html

<p align="center">Q2: What is the encoding used by the attacker on the c2 connection?

We know that the attacker's c2 is the "resolvecyber.xyz" domain and after looking at the URI, we can guess that the attacker is using the Base64 encoding. We can test that by going to a decoder and decoding the string that comes after "?q=".

<p align="center"><h3>Discovery - Internal Reconnaissance</h3>

Internal Reconnaissance

Based on the collected findings, we have discovered that the malicious binary continuously uses the <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">C2</span> traffic:

- We can easily decode the encoded string in the network traffic.
- The traffic contains the command and output executed by the attacker.

Investigation Guide

To continue with the investigation, we may focus on the following information:

- Find network and process events connecting to the malicious domain.
- Find network events that contain an encoded command.
- We can use Brim to filter all packets containing the encoded string.
- Look for endpoint enumeration commands since the attacker is already inside the machine.

In addition, we may refer to our cheatsheet for Brim to quickly investigate the encoded traffic with the following filters:

- To get all <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">HTTP</span> requests related to the malicious <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">C2</span> traffic: `_path=="http" "<replace domain>" id.resp_p==<replace port> | cut ts, host, id.resp_p, uri | sort ts`

Significant Data Sources:
