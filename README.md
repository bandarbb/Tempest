- Follow the child processes of WinWord.exe.
- Use filters such as ParentProcessID or ProcessID to correlate the relationship of each process.
- We can focus on Sysmon events such as Process Creation (Event ID 1) and <span style="color: #d4d0ca;">DNS</span> Queries (Event ID 22) to correlate the activity generated by the malicious document.

With filter process id 496 (winword.exe). From the record number and moving forward event id 1 (process creation) event id 13 (registry event)Â  event id 11 (fire create) event id 3 (Network connection) event id 15 (FileCreateStreamHash) event id 22 (DNS event). All of which from user benimaru.

What is the base64 encoded string in the malicious payload executed by the document?

We know that the process id that opened the malicious file is 496. Now we have to look for any child process it has created by filtering it as a parent process id. In this case, it's on "Payload Data5" column
